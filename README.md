## Requirements

1. Project should use CLEAN architecture, proper naming convention, security, and comply with Rest API. In README file, explain the structure of your project as well.
    - PS: you could use the normal layered architecture (Controller, Service, and Repo) However, it is recommended to practice the CLEAN architecture
2. Error handler: This will ensure any exceptions thrown in your application are handled appropriately and helpful error messages are returned.
3. `README` file should sufficiently describe the project, as well as the deployment.


#### How to work as a team
1. As a team you should have daily communication (the more, the better).
2. Decide what tasks you would be working on (The smaller, the better, so code can get merged asap)
3. You could split the task based on features. one would take the user flow, the other product, etc.
    - HOWEVER, You don't have to take the entire flow from end to end as your own responsibility.
      you could be working on users first, and then products, or repo, etc.
4. Make sure you set deadlines for every 2 days.
